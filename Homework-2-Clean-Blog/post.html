      <p class="paragraph">Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere,
         a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, 
         in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men 
         occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, 
         not in theory.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no 
        turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her 
          protectors rather than her violators. 
          That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.
        </p>
        <h1 class="paragraph">The Final Frontier</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
          There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, 
          it is a task to occupy the generations. 
          And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical 
          process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
        </p>
        <h1 class="paragraph">Reaching for the Stars</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. 
          Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, 
          that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption paragraph">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
